## Classification of 5G Data

## **Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to accurately classify 5G data signals in 4QAM, 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, and 64QAM. To accomplish this, we have employed multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) models and discovered that DenseNet exhibits superior accuracy, surpassing all others with a rate of 98.7%.
